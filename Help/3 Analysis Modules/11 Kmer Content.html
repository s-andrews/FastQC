<h1>3.11 - Kmer Content</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The analysis of overrepresented sequences will spot an increase in
any exactly duplicated sequences, but there are a different subset
of problems where it will not work.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have very long sequences with poor sequence quality then
random sequencing errors will dramatically reduce the counts for
exactly duplicated sequences.
</li>
<li>If you have a partial sequence which is appearing at a variety
of places within your sequence then this won't be seen either by the
per base content plot or the duplicate sequence analysis.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Kmer module starts from the assumption that any small fragment
of sequence should not have a positional bias in its apearance within
a diverse library.  There may be biological reasons why certain Kmers
are enriched or depleted overall, but these biases should affect all
positions within a sequence equally.  This module therefore measures the
number of each 7-mer at each position in your library and then uses
a binomial test to look for significant deviations from an even
coverage at all positions.  Any Kmers with positionally biased enrichment
are reported.  The top 6 most biased Kmer are additionally plotted to
show their distribution.

<p>
To allow this module to run in a reasonable time only 2% of the whole
library is analysed and the results are extrapolated to the rest of
the library.  Sequences longer than 500bp are truncated to 500bp for
this analysis.
</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>
This module will issue a warning if any k-mer is imbalanced with a binomial
p-value <0.01.
</p>

<h2>Failure</h2>
<p>
This module will issue a warning if any k-mer is imbalanced with a binomial
p-value < 10^-5.
</p>

<h2>Common reasons for warnings</h2>
<p>
Any individually overrepresented sequences, even if not present at a high enough
threshold to trigger the overrepresented sequences module will cause the Kmers from
those sequences to be highly enriched in this module.  These will normally appear
as sharp spikes of enrichemnt at a single point in the sequence, rather than a
progressive or broad enrichment.
</p>
<p>
Libraries which derive from random priming will nearly always show Kmer bias at
the start of the library due to an incomplete sampling of the possible random
primers.
