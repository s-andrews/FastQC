<h1>Duplicate Sequences</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In a diverse library most sequences will occur only once in the final
set. A slightly elevated level of duplication may indicate a very high
level of coverage of the target sequence, but a high level of duplication
is more likely to indicate some kind of enrichment bias (eg PCR over
amplification).
</p>
<p>
This module counts the degree of duplication for every sequence in
a library and creates a plot showing the relative number of sequences
with different degrees of duplication.
</p>

<p>
To cut down on the memory requirements for this module only sequences
which first appear in the first 100,000 sequences in each file are analysed,
and these are then tracked through the entire dataset.  This should be enough 
to get a good impression for the duplication levels in the whole file.  
Each sequence is tracked to the end of the file to give a representative 
count of the overall duplication level.  
To cut down  on the amount of information in the final plot any sequences 
with more than 10 duplicates are placed into grouped bins to give a clear
impression of the overall duplication level without having to show each
individual duplication value.
</p>

<p>
Because the duplication detection requires an exact sequence match over
the whole length of the sequence, any reads over 50bp in length are truncated
to 50bp for the purposes of this analysis.  Even so, longer reads are more
likely to contain sequencing errors which will artificially increase the
observed diversity and will tend to underrepresent highly duplicated sequences.
</p>

<p>
The plot shows the proportion of the library which is made up of sequences in
each of the different duplication level bins.  The x axis is the degree of 
duplication, and the y axis shows the proportion of the library which is made
up of reads with that level of duplication.
</p>

<p>
In a properly diverse library most sequences should fall into the far left of the
plot .  A general level of enrichment, indicating broad
oversequencing in the library will tend to flatten the line, lowering the low end and 
generally raising other categories.  More specific enrichments of subsets, or the 
presence of low complexity contaminants will tend to produce spikes towards the right
of the plot.
</p>

<p>
The module also calculates an expected overall loss of sequence were the library to be
deduplicated. This headline figure is shown at the top of the plot and gives a reasonable
impression of the potential overall level of loss.
</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>
This module will issue a warning if non-unique sequences make up more than
30% of the total.
</p>

<h2>Failure</h2>
<p>
This module will issue a error if non-unique sequences make up more than
50% of the total.
</p>

<h2>Common reasons for warnings</h2>
<p>
The underlying assumption of this module is of a diverse unenriched library.  Any deviation 
from this assumption will naturally generate duplicates and can lead to warnings or errors
from this module.
</p>
<p>
In general there are two potential types of duplicate in a library, technical duplicates 
arising from PCR artefacts, or biological duplicates which are natural collisions where different
copies of exactly the same sequence are randomly selected.  From a sequence level there is no
way to distinguish between these two types and both will be reported as duplicates here.
</p>
<p>
A warning or error in this module is simply a statement that you have exhausted the diversity
in at least part of your library and are re-sequencing the same sequences.  In a supposedly diverse
library this would suggest that the diversity has been partially or completely exhausted and that
you are therefore wasting sequencing capacity.  However in some library types you will naturally
tend to over-sequence parts of the library and therefore generate duplication and will therefore
expect to see warnings or error from this module.
</p>
<p>
In RNA-Seq libraries sequences from different transcripts will be present at wildly different levels
in the starting population.  In order to be able to observe lowly expressed transcripts it is therefore
common to greatly over-sequence high expressed transcripts, and this will potentially create large
set of duplicates.  This will result in high overall duplication in this test, and will often produce
peaks in the higher duplication bins.  This duplication will come from physically connected regions, and
an examination of the distribution of duplicates in a specific genomic region will allow the
distinction between over-sequencing and general technical duplication, but these distinctions are not
possible from raw fastq files.  A similar situation can arise in highly enriched ChIP-Seq libraries
although the duplication there is less pronounced.  Finally, if you have a library where the sequence
start points are constrained (a library constructed around restriction sites for example, or an
unfragmented small RNA library) then the constrained start sites will generate huge dupliction levels
which should not be treated as a problem, nor removed by deduplication.  In these types of library 
you should consider using a system such as random barcoding to allow the distinction of technical
and biological duplicates.
