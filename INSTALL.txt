Installing FastQC
-------------------

OSX
---
FastQC is distributed as a DMG image file.  Download the image from the project page
and double click it to open it.  You should see the FastQC application appear in a
Finder window.  Drag the application from there to wherever you want to install it 
on your machine.  Once you've copied the application double click it to open it.

FastQC is not a signed application therefore it may initially be blocked by the
Gatekeeper application.  To avoid this open FastQC by right clicking on the app 
and selecting open.  This may prompt you to allow it to open.  If it is still 
blocked go to System Preferences > Security and Privacy and you should see an option
to allow the application to open.  You only need to do this once and the preference
should be remembered by OSX.

Windows and Linux
-----------------
FastQC is a java application.  In order to run it needs your system to have a suitable
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.  Before you try to run FastQC you should 
therefore ensure that you have a suitable JRE.  There are a number of different JREs 
available however the ones we have tested are the latest Oracle runtime environments 
and those from the adoptOpenJDK project (https://adoptopenjdk.net/).  You need to 
download and install a suitable 64-bit JRE and make sure that the java application 
is in your path (most installers will take care of this for you).

On linux most distributions will have java installed already so you might not need to
do anything.  If java isn't installed then you can add it by doing:

Ubuntu / Mint: sudo apt install default-jre

CentOS / Redhat: sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

You can check whether java is installed by opening the 'cmd' program on windows, or
any shell on linux and typing:

java -version

You should see something like:

>java -version
openjdk version "11.0.2" 2019-01-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.2+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.2+9, mixed mode)


Actually installing FastQC is as simple as unzipping the zip file it comes in into a
suitable location.  That's it.  Once unzipped it's ready to go.

Running FastQC
--------------

You can run FastQC in one of two modes, either as an interactive graphical application
in which you can dynamically load FastQ files and view their results.

Alternatively you can run FastQC in a non-interactive mode where you specify the files
you want to process on the command line and FastQC will generate an HTML report for
each file without launching a user interface.  This would allow FastQC to be run as
part of an analysis pipeline.


Running FastQC Interactively
----------------------------
Windows: Simply double click on the run_fastqc bat file.  If you want to make a pretty 
shortcut then we've included an icon file in the top level directory so you don't have
to use the generic bat file icon.

MacOSX: Double click on the FastQC application icon.

Linux:  We have included a wrapper script, called 'fastqc' which is the easiest way to 
start the program.  The wrapper is in the top level of the FastQC installation.  You 
may need to make this file executable:

chmod 755 fastqc

..but once you have done that you can run it directly

./fastqc

..or place a link in /usr/local/bin to be able to run the program from any location:

sudo ln -s /path/to/FastQC/fastqc /usr/local/bin/fastqc


Running FastQC as part of a pipeline
------------------------------------
To run FastQC non-interactively you should use the fastqc wrapper script to launch
the program.  You will probably want to use the zipped install file on every platform
(even OSX).

To run non-interactively you simply have to specify a list of files to process
on the commandline

fastqc somefile.txt someotherfile.txt

You can specify as many files to process in a single run as you like.  If you don't
specify any files to process the program will try to open the interactive application
which may result in an error if you're running in a non-graphical environment.

There are a few extra options you can specify when running non-interactively.  Full
details of these can be found by running 

fastqc --help

By default, in non-interactive mode FastQC will create an HTML report with embedded
graphs, but also a zip file containing individual graph files and additional data files
containing the raw data from which plots were drawn.  The zip file will not be extracted
by default but you can enable this by adding:

--extract

To the launch command.

If you want to save your reports in a folder other than the folder which contained
your original FastQ files then you can specify an alternative location by setting a
--outdir value:

--outdir=/some/other/dir/

If you want to run fastqc on a stream of data to be read from standard input then you
can do this by specifing 'stdin' as the name of the file to be processed and then 
streaming uncompressed fastq format data to the program.  For example:

zcat *fastq.gz | fastqc stdin

If you want the results from a streamed analysis sent to a file with a name other than
stdin then you can add a colon and put the file name you want, for example:

zcat *fastq.gz | fastqc stdin:my_results

..would write results to my_result.html and my_results.zip.


Customising the report output
-----------------------------

If you want to run FastQC as part of a sequencing pipeline you may wish to change the
formatting of the report to add in your own branding or to include extra information.

In the Templates directory you will find a file called 'header_template.html' which
you can edit to change the look of the report.  This file contains all of the header for
the report file, including the CSS section and you can alter this however you see fit.

Whilst you can make whatever changes you like you should probably leave in place the
<div> structure of the html template since later code will expect to close the main div
which is left open at the end of the header.  There is no facility to change the code in
the main body of the report or the footer (although you can of course change the styling).

The text tags @@FILENAME@@ and @@DATE@@ are placeholders which are filled in when the
report it created.  You can use these placeholders in other parts of the header if you
wish.
